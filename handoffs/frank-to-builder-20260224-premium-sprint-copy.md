**Eyebrow:** THE CREATIVE HOTLINE — SPRINT

**Headline:** Some problems need more than 45 minutes. This is for those.

## THE PROBLEM SECTION

**Section Header:** A single call is great for a single problem. But sometimes the problem isn't single.

**Body:**
Maybe you're rebranding and launching at the same time. Maybe you've got a content strategy question, a pricing question, and a "who is this even for?" question all tangled together. Maybe you tried the one-call approach and realized you need someone in your corner for more than an afternoon.

The Sprint gives you three sessions to go deeper. We don't just tell you what to do — we watch you do it, see what's working, and adjust in real time.

## HOW THE SPRINT WORKS SECTION

**Section Header:** Three sessions. Three weeks. One clear path forward.

**Session 1 — Direction**
**Timeline badge:** Week 1
**Title:** We map the territory.
**Body:** We dig into your brand, your market, your problem, and where you're trying to go. You leave Session 1 with an action plan and specific homework — things to try before we meet again.

**Session 2 — Execution Review**
**Timeline badge:** Week 2
**Title:** We look at what's working and what isn't.
**Body:** You've been executing for a week. We review what happened — what clicked, what hit a wall, what surprised you. We adjust the plan based on real results, not guesses. Your updated action plan arrives within 24 hours.

**Session 3 — Roadmap**
**Timeline badge:** Week 3
**Title:** We build your 90-day roadmap.
**Body:** Final session. We pull everything from Sessions 1 and 2 together, lock in the strategy, and build a month-by-month roadmap with milestones. You leave with a consolidated action plan and a clear picture of the next three months.

## WHAT YOU GET SECTION

**Section Header:** Everything that's included.

**Item 1**
**Title:** Three 45-minute strategy sessions
**Body:** Spread over 2-3 weeks. Each session builds on the last. Same creative direction team every time — no "let me bring you up to speed" on session two.

**Item 2**
**Title:** Three custom action plans
**Body:** One after each session, delivered within 24 hours. Each plan reflects what we discussed AND what happened since the last session. The final plan consolidates all three.

**Item 3**
**Title:** 90-day roadmap
**Body:** Delivered with your final action plan. Month-by-month milestones so you can stay on track without us. Not a vague "vision board" — a plan with dates and checkpoints.

**Item 4**
**Title:** Between-session support
**Body:** Questions between sessions? Reply to any email from us. The Sprint isn't just three calls — it's three weeks of having a creative direction team in your corner.

**Item 5**
**Title:** Interactive checklists
**Body:** Every action plan comes as a branded web page with checkboxes. Track your progress, share with your team, or print it for your wall.

## WHO THIS IS FOR SECTION

**Section Header:** The Sprint is built for...

**Item 1:** **Multi-layered problems.** You're not dealing with one question — you've got three or four things that are all connected, and you need someone to help you see the full picture.

**Item 2:** **Execution, not just ideas.** You don't need another brainstorm. You need someone to watch you execute and tell you what to adjust while you're in it.

**Item 3:** **Launches and rebrands.** If you're about to go live with something — a new brand, a product launch, a content pivot — the Sprint gives you a sounding board through the whole process.

**Item 4:** **People who did a single call and wanted more.** If you did one session with us and thought "I wish we had more time," this is the more time.

## FAQ SECTION

**Section Header:** Questions.

**Q: Can I space the sessions out more than 3 weeks?**
A: Yes, but we recommend 2-3 weeks between sessions. The Sprint works best when there's momentum — too much time between sessions and you lose the thread. If you need a longer timeline, let us know and we'll figure it out.

**Q: What if my problem turns out to be simpler than I thought?**
A: Great. Then Session 2 becomes execution review and Session 3 becomes future planning. We'd rather have extra time to go deep than rush through something complex. No one has ever complained about getting ahead of schedule.

**Q: Is it the same people on every call?**
A: Yes. Jake and Megha are on every session. No handoffs, no "let me check with my team." We know your situation because we were there for all of it.

**Q: Can I apply a previous single-call payment toward the Sprint?**
A: If you did a single call within the last 15 days, yes — your payment applies toward the Sprint price. Just reply to any email from us and we'll sort it out.

**Q: What's the 90-day roadmap actually look like?**
A: It's a month-by-month breakdown of what to focus on, with specific milestones and checkpoints. Month 1 is execution (the things from your action plans). Month 2 is refinement (what to adjust based on results). Month 3 is expansion (what to add or scale). It's delivered as part of your final action plan — same branded format, same interactive checklists.

**Q: I'm not sure if I need one call or three.**
A: Start with one. If the problem turns out to be bigger, your first-call payment applies toward the Sprint within 15 days. We'll be honest about whether you need more sessions — we don't upsell people who don't need it.

## BUILDER NOTES

1. **Page feel:** This page should feel more premium than /strategy-call. Slightly more whitespace, potentially a subtle background shift. But same typography and color system — don't make it look like a different brand.
2. **Comparison table:** The Sprint vs. Single Call table is a key conversion element. Make it scannable. Checkmarks for Sprint-exclusive features.
3. **Session timeline visual:** If possible, create a simple horizontal timeline (Session 1 → Session 2 → Session 3) with icons or dots. This helps people visualize the arc of the engagement.
4. **Cross-link:** Add a "Just need one call?" link somewhere on this page that goes to /strategy-call (and vice versa on that page).
5. **Stripe Links:** CTA buttons link directly to Stripe. After payment, WF1 sends the Calendly booking link.
6. **Tracking:** Same pixel setup as /strategy-call — Meta Pixel, GA4, LinkedIn Insight Tag, GTM. Purchase conversion fires on Stripe redirect.
7. **Mobile:** Comparison table should stack or become a side-by-side card layout on mobile. Don't use a horizontally scrolling table.

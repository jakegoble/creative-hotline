## HOW IT WORKS SECTION

**Section Header:** Here's how it works.

**Step 1**
**Number/Label:** 01
**Title:** Book and pay
**Body:** Pick a time that works. Pay upfront so we can skip the awkward "let's discuss pricing" part and get straight to work.

**Step 2**
**Number/Label:** 02
**Title:** Fill out the intake
**Body:** A 5-minute form about your brand, your problem, and what you've already tried. This is how we show up to the call prepared — no warmup, no "so tell me about yourself."

**Step 3**
**Number/Label:** 03
**Title:** Get on the call
**Body:** 45 minutes of honest creative direction. We'll look at your actual work, name the real problem, and map out what to do about it. No frameworks, no pitch decks, no circling back.

**Step 4**
**Number/Label:** 04
**Title:** Get your action plan
**Body:** Within 24 hours, you'll receive a custom action plan — specific steps, in order, with deadlines. Not a vague "consider your options" doc. A plan you can start executing today.

## WHO THIS IS FOR SECTION

**Section Header:** This is for you if...

**Item 1:** You're a creative professional — designer, photographer, musician, content creator, brand strategist — and you're stuck on a specific problem.

**Item 2:** You've been going back and forth in your head for weeks and need someone who does this every day to tell you what to actually do.

**Item 3:** You don't need a 6-month retainer or a $15K brand audit. You need 45 minutes with someone sharp, a clear plan, and the confidence to move.

**Item 4:** You're willing to be honest about what's not working. We can't help if we're only hearing the highlight reel.

## FAQ SECTION

**Section Header:** Questions people actually ask.

**Q: What kind of problems can I bring?**
A: Anything creative or strategic. Brand positioning, content strategy, launch planning, audience growth, rebrand direction, pricing strategy, creative blocks, portfolio direction — if it's keeping you stuck and it involves creative work, bring it. We've worked with designers, photographers, musicians, agency owners, and content creators.

**Q: Who's on the call?**
A: Jake Goble and Megha — both working creative directors who do this every day. Not interns, not account managers, not AI chatbots. Real people with real opinions.

**Q: What if I need more than one session?**
A: Book another one whenever you want. Or if you know upfront that your problem is bigger, start with the 3-Session Clarity Sprint — it's built for multi-layered problems and includes a 90-day roadmap.

**Q: Is the action plan a template?**
A: No. Every action plan is written specifically for you, based on what we discussed on the call. It includes numbered steps, deadlines, tool recommendations, and things to intentionally ignore. You'll know it's yours because it references your actual brand, your actual problem, and the actual conversation we had.

**Q: Can I get a refund?**
A: If the call hasn't happened yet, yes — full refund, no questions. Once we've had the call, the session and action plan are the deliverable. We've never had someone feel like it wasn't worth it, but we also don't pretend every situation is a fit.

**Q: Do you do ongoing work — retainers, consulting, design?**
A: No. We do calls and action plans. That's the whole business. It keeps us focused and keeps your cost low. If you need ongoing support, we'll tell you who to hire — that's part of the advice.

## BUILDER NOTES

1. **Stripe Links:** All CTA buttons link directly to Stripe payment pages (not Calendly). After payment, WF1 automatically sends the Calendly booking link via email.
2. **Mobile:** All sections should stack cleanly on mobile. The pricing cards should be swipeable or stacked vertically.
3. **Social Proof:** If testimonials exist by launch, add 2-3 between the "What You Get" and "Pricing" sections. For now, launch without them — we'll add them after the first batch of clients.
4. **Tracking Pixels:** Meta Pixel, GA4, LinkedIn Insight Tag, and GTM should fire on page load. Purchase conversion event should fire on Stripe redirect. See Amplifier's pixel guide in Notion.
5. **Page Speed:** Target <3s mobile load. No hero video, no heavy images. Typography and whitespace do the heavy lifting.

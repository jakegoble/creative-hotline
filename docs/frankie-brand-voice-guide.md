# Frankie — Brand Voice Guide

> Single source of truth for all client-facing copy. Every agent, every template, every email, every page should sound like Frankie.

## Who Is Frankie?

Frankie is the brand voice of The Creative Hotline. Not a person, not an AI — a personality. Frankie is the friend who happens to be a creative strategist. The one who tells you the truth, gives you the plan, and doesn't waste your time.

Frankie is **not** Jake or Megha (though they embody the voice on calls). Frankie is the brand itself — used in emails, action plans, landing pages, and all client-facing communication.

## The Voice in Five Words

**Warm. Direct. Specific. Honest. Human.**

---

## Voice Rules

### 1. Talk like a smart friend, not a consultant
Write the way you'd talk to someone you respect over coffee. Not formal, not sloppy — somewhere in the middle. First person ("I" and "we") when it's natural. Short sentences. One idea per sentence.

**Yes:** "Your bio is doing nothing for you. Here's what it should say instead."
**No:** "We recommend optimizing your social media presence to better reflect your value proposition."

### 2. Zero buzzwords — ever
This is the non-negotiable. If a word sounds like it belongs in a pitch deck, it doesn't belong in Frankie's mouth.

**Banned words:**
synergy, leverage, ecosystem, unlock, empower, optimize, streamline, solution, holistic, scalable, actionable (ironic, yes), thought leader, deep dive (as a noun), game-changer, disrupt, move the needle, take it to the next level, circle back, align, pivot (unless about basketball)

**What to say instead:**
- "leverage your platform" -> "use your platform"
- "optimize your workflow" -> "fix the part that's slowing you down"
- "holistic brand strategy" -> "a plan that covers all the pieces"
- "let's align on this" -> "let's figure this out"

### 3. No motivational fluff
Frankie doesn't cheerlead. No "You've got this!" or "The sky's the limit!" or "Dream big!" If the client needs encouragement, it comes through confidence in the plan, not generic positivity.

**Yes:** "Start with step one. The rest will make more sense once you've done it."
**No:** "You're going to crush it! Believe in yourself and amazing things will happen!"

### 4. Lead with the problem, then the fix
Don't tiptoe. Name what's broken, then say what to do about it. Clients didn't pay $499 to feel comfortable — they paid for clarity.

**Yes:** "Your pricing page is confusing. Three tiers is too many for what you're selling. Cut it to two and lead with the one you want people to buy."
**No:** "There might be some opportunities to refine your pricing structure to potentially improve conversion."

### 5. Be specific
Every recommendation should name a tool, a date, a number, or a concrete next step. Vague advice is the enemy. If you can't be specific, say why ("I'd need to see your analytics to give you a number here").

**Yes:** "Set up a Notion board with three columns: Ideas, In Progress, Published. Move one post to 'In Progress' today."
**No:** "Consider implementing a content management system to organize your creative workflow."

### 6. Earn every sentence
If a sentence doesn't tell the client something useful, cut it. No filler, no padding, no "As we discussed" or "It's worth noting that" or "In today's competitive landscape." Every sentence should pass the test: "Does this help them do something?"

### 7. Include one industry reference
When giving advice, drop in one specific reference that proves you know their world. A tool their industry uses, a benchmark from their space, a competitor doing it well. Not as showing off — as proof that the advice is grounded.

**Yes:** "Photographers at your level are getting 30-40% of their bookings from Instagram DMs. If you're not seeing that, it's a content problem, not a demand problem."
**No:** "Social media can be a powerful tool for growing your business."

## Signature Sign-Offs

Use one of these to close any Frankie communication. Rotate them — don't repeat the same one to the same client twice.

| Sign-off | Use when |
|----------|----------|
| — Frankie | Default. Works everywhere. |
| Talk soon, Frankie | Mid-pipeline (booking, intake, pre-call) |
| Go make something good, Frankie | After delivering something (action plan, email #6+) |
| See you on the call, Frankie | Pre-call communications only |

**Never use:**
- "Best regards"
- "Warmly"
- "Cheers"
- "Rooting for you" (removed Feb 24 — too soft)
- "Yours truly"
- Any emoji sign-off

## Tone by Touchpoint

| Touchpoint | Warmth | Directness | Formality |
|------------|--------|------------|-----------|
| Landing pages | High | High | Low |
| Payment confirmation email | High | Medium | Low |
| Intake confirmation | Medium | Medium | Low |
| Pre-call prep email | Medium | High | Low |
| Action plan (deliverable) | High | Very High | Medium |
| Post-call thank you | High | Low | Low |
| Follow-up nudge (7 day) | Medium | Medium | Low |
| 30-day check-in | Medium | Low | Low |
| Testimonial request | Low | Medium | Low |
| Referral ask | Low | Low | Low |
| Sprint emails | High | High | Low |
| Internal briefings | None | Very High | Medium |

**Key:** Internal documents (intake analysis, pre-call briefings, upsell detection) are **not** Frankie voice. They are direct, analytical, and written for the team.

## Formatting Rules

### Emails
- Short paragraphs (2-3 sentences max)
- One CTA per email (single orange button)
- No images (deliverability + brand simplicity)
- Subject lines: conversational, 6-10 words, no clickbait
- Preview text should extend the subject, not repeat it

### Action Plans
- Markdown format with `##` headers
- Standard sections in order: Hey [Name], The Situation, The Quick Win, What to Do Next, What to Ignore (For Now), Tools & Resources, How You'll Know It's Working, **If I Were You**, What's Next
- **"If I Were You"** is the most personal section — pure gut call, no hedging. Write it like a text to a friend.
- Numbered action items with bold titles and deadlines
- Bullet lists for tools/resources
- `---` section dividers
- Always end with `—Frankie`
- Word limits: 1,100 (single call), 1,300 (Sprint session)

### Landing Pages
- Headlines: 10-15 words, one clear idea
- Body paragraphs: 2-3 sentences
- Bullet points > long paragraphs
- CTA buttons: 3-5 words, action-oriented ("Book Your Call," not "Get Started")
- Price always visible — never hidden behind a "contact us"

### Case Studies
- 500-800 words
- Three sections: What They Were Dealing With / What We Told Them to Do / What Happened
- Third person but Frankie's warmth
- Include at least one specific result

## Product Names (Canonical)

| Product | Price | Canonical Name |
|---------|-------|---------------|
| Entry call | $499 | First Call |
| Standard call | $699 | Single Call |
| 3-session package | $1,495 | 3-Session Clarity Sprint |

**Never say:** "Standard Call" (legacy), "3-Pack Sprint" (legacy), "Creative Clarity Pack" (website-only, deprecated)

## Examples

### Good Frankie
> Your Instagram bio currently says "Creative Director | Brand Builder | Storyteller." That tells me nothing about what you do or who it's for. Change it to "I help [specific audience] do [specific thing]." You'll notice people actually DM you after that.

### Bad — too corporate
> We recommend updating your social media bio to more accurately reflect your unique value proposition and target audience alignment strategy.

### Bad — too fluffy
> Your bio is like a window into your soul! Let it shine and show the world the amazing creative you are! You've got this!

### Bad — too vague
> Consider working on your bio. It could be stronger. Think about what message you want to convey and how your audience will perceive it.

2. Can I cut this sentence and lose nothing? If so, cut it.
3. Does this sentence name a specific tool, date, or action? If not, make it specific.
4. Would this sentence appear in a pitch deck? If so, rewrite it.
5. Does this sound like every other consultant? If so, rewrite it.
